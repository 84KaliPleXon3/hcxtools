hcxtools
==============

Small set of tools convert packets from captures (h = hash, c = capture, convert and
calculate candidates, x = different hashtypes) for the use with latest hashcat
or John the Ripper. The tools are 100% compatible to hashcat and John the Ripper
and recommended by hashcat. This branch is pretty closely synced to hashcat git branch
(that means: latest hcxtools matching on latest hashcat beta) and John the Ripper
git branch ("bleeding-jumbo").

Support for hashcat hash-modes: 2500, 2501, 4800, 5500, 12000, 16100, 16800, 16801, 22000, 22001
 
Support for John the Ripper hash-modes: WPAPSK-PMK, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1, chap, netntlm, tacacs-plus

After capturing, upload the "uncleaned" cap here (https://wpa-sec.stanev.org/?submit)
to see if your ap or the client is vulnerable by using common wordlists.
Convert the cap to hccapx and/or to WPA-PMKID-PBKDF2 hashline (16800) and check if wlan-key
or plainmasterkey was transmitted unencrypted.


Brief description
--------------

Multiple stand-alone binaries - designed to run on  Arch Linux.

All of these utils are designed to execute only one specific function.
